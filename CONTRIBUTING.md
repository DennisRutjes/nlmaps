How to contribute
=================

Contribution should be done in a separate branch. You can run tests as described in the [README](https://github.com/geo-frontend/nlmaps#developing).


All branches that get pushed to github.com/geo-frontend/nlmaps also have tests run on CircleCI. When tests pass, create a pull request to the `develop` branch.


Pull requests merged to `develop` are automatically tested and then merged into master, tagged, and released on Github (see [releases](https://github.com/geo-frontend/nlmaps/releases)) and [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@geo-frontend/nlmaps).
